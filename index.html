      <p>
        I am a Los Angeles native, currently working as creative video editor making hit television shows. 
        I also have a background in music and audio engineering which helps round out my skillset when working on different projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a beautiful wife and son, and live in the foothills of the San Gabriel mountains among the bears and coyotes. 
        I like to practice yoga, play music, hike, and spend time with friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have just begun learning how to code. 
        I'm currently learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and am hoping that this is the start of a new career path for me.
